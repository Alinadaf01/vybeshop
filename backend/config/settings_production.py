"""Production settings overlay (§8 deploy prep) — NOT wired up as the active
settings module anywhere by default; the container/Compose setup this ships
alongside sets `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings_production`
explicitly (see ../../docker-compose.prod.yml and ../../DEPLOY.md).

Everything environment-sensitive (DEBUG, ALLOWED_HOSTS, DATABASE_URL,
SECRET_KEY, the SECURE_* hardening block, ...) already lives in
config/settings.py and is driven entirely by env vars — that's the
single source of truth both here and in local dev. This module only adds
the handful of things that should be true in production specifically and
would be actively wrong in local dev, so they don't belong behind a `DEBUG`
check in the shared file.
